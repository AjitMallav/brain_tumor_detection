# Brain Tumor Detection Model

This project employs deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to accurately detect brain tumors in medical images, particularly MRI scans. Leveraging transfer learning with the VGG19 architecture, the model is fine-tuned on a dataset of MRI images, enabling it to distinguish between tumor and non-tumor regions with relatively high precision. The project encompasses a comprehensive pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter optimization, and evaluation metrics to ensure robust performance. With potential applications in medical diagnostics, this project aims to contribute to early detection and treatment planning for brain tumor patients.
